# Atmos_params
This is my first repository on Analysis of Atmospheric Parameters for different stations.
● Introduction   

Collection of past 20 years data-sets of Rainfall, Relative Humidity & Temperature of 9 different
stations across India as Inland, East-Coast, and West-Coast. The cities taken are Delhi, Jaipur,
Bangalore, Mumbai, Mangaluru, Kochin, Kolkata, Visakhapatnam, and Chennai.
The data sets are taken from Data sets are taken from https://power.larc.nasa.gov/
Past Data-sets from 2000 to 2021 have been taken under consideration
The Graphs of the cities are divided as
● The Inland Cities, consisting of the cities Delhi, Jaipur, and Bangalore.
● The West-Coast, consists of the cities of Mumbai, Mangaluru, and Kochin and
● The East-Coast, consisting of the cities of Kolkata, , Visakhapatnam and Chennai.
And the graphs are seasonally made, the different graph for a different season of these cities, are
● Pre-Monsoon, consisting of the months of March, April, and May
● Monsoon, consisting of months June, July, August, and September
● Post-Monsoon, consisting of months October, November, and December

Seasonal and Coast wise city variation can be seen, with different seasons and cities showing different
characteristics of data of Rainfall, Relative Humidity & Temperature.



● Objective: Developing a Visualization tool in python for understanding the seasonal variation of
meteorological variables.


● Visual Representation of Atmospheric Variables which is already in my atmos_params.ipnyb file


● Result and Discussion

It can be seen with the help of graphical visualization that in Inland the variation of
temperature during the Pre-monsoon season is between 26 to 32°C, the Monsoon season is
between 22 to 34 oC, and post-monsoon it varies between 19 to 23°C.
Now for the East-coast, the variation of temperature during the Pre-monsoon season is
between 29 to 31°C, the Monsoon season is between 28 to 31°C and Post-monsoon varies
between 20 to 26°C.

And for West-coast the variation of temperature during the pre-monsoon season is between 27
to 31°C, the Monsoon season is between 23 to 27°C and Post-monsoon varies between 23 to
27°C.

For Relative humidity in Inland, during the Pre-monsoon season is between 16% to 60%, the
Monsoon season is between 40% to 82% and Post-monsoon is varying between 20% to 87%.
Now for East-coast, variation during the Monsoon season is between 55% to 72%, during
Monsoon season it is between 64% to 90% and Post-monsoon varies between 70% to 86%.
And for West-coast the variation during the monsoon season is between 50% to 80%, the
Monsoon season is between 82% to 90% and Post-monsoon varies between 58% to 90%.

For Rainfall in Inland, during the Pre-monsoon season is between 0 to 3.5mm/day, Monsoon
season it is between 0.5 to 7mm/day, and Post–monsoon is varying between 0 to 6mm/day.
Now for East Coast, the pre-Monsoon season is between 0 to 5mm/day, the Monsoon season is
between 2.5 to 14mm/day and Post-monsoon is varies between 0.5 to 15mm/day.
And for the West-coast the variation during the Pre-monsoon season is between 0 to
11mm/day, Monsoon season is between 7 to 33.5mm/day, and Post-Monsoon varies between 0
to 11mm/day.

Among the Inland stations, Bangalore has the lowest temperature among the three, in the east
coast station all stations have around the same temperature in pre-monsoon and monsoon but
Kolkata has the lowest temperature during the post-monsoon season. Whereas in west coast
stations during the pre-monsoon and monsoon temperature is almost the same but in
post-monsoon Mumbai has the lowest temperature.

At the Inland stations, Bangalore has the highest Relative Humidity among all stations. For the
east coast, the range is almost the same although during pre-monsoon Vishakhapatnam has the
highest Relative Humidity, and during monsoon, Kolkata has the highest. For the West coast
during the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon Mumbai has the lowest Relative Humidity and
during the monsoon all have almost the same relative humidity.

At the Inland stations, Bangalore has the highest rainfall during pre-monsoon and
post-monsoon and almost the same during monsoon. On the east coast, the rainfall of Kolkata
is highest during the monsoon and Chennai has the highest rainfall during post-monsoon. On
the west coast, Kochin has the highest rainfall during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon and
Mangaluru has the highest rainfall during the monsoon.
